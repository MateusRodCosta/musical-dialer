# Musical Dialer

A Dialer app whose only purpose is to make the DTMF sounds you get when
you dial on a normal phone.

Currently the GUI is planned to be a copy of the Google Phone app's dialer,
but it is still not quite there.

Currently sound playing doesn't work.

## Why?

One very cool thing you can try and do on these dialers is play some songs.
See [this video](https://youtu.be/Yuk46XbvwUY) for an example and this
[other video](https://youtu.be/4XS1SAG1q-w) for a slower version on a
Samsung smartphone.
